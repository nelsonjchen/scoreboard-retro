> Retro Scoreboard

Used for Southern California Retro Gaming Expo scoreboard for the 
Nintendo World championship 1990 reproduction cartridge. Needed 
something that'll work from a phone and some pretty formatting 
for people coming in. Need it in an hour or two. This'll do. 

WARNING: No authentication setup. Be nice or just hide.
